Dependencies

* Python 2.7(I know)
* pyserial
* requests
* Tkinter(should come with python)

"You have to be hit by a factory line, literally, a factory line, to use it, because the keys are so complex. It's virtually useless. And remember the PCH system?... I have so many laptops, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do provisioning. It costs me $3."
